PIC(L)F1826/1827 serial via A/D bootloader

This is a bootloader for the above mentioned Microchip processor.

It does software serial communication with the A/D converter as input, allowing you to change the input threshold to suite any analog sensor.
It could quite easily be modified to transfer several bits per cycle, or to receive communication by other means, such as audio for example.

I wrote this to download new firmware to a homebrew wristwatch, using its light sensor to receive, and an LED on its dial to transmit.
